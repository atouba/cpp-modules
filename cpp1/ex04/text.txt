Extracts characters from is and stores them into str until the delimitation character delim is found (or the newline character, '\n', for (2)).

The extraction also stops if the end of file is reached in is or if some other error occurs during the input operation.

If the delimiter is found, it is extracted and discarded (i.e. it is not stored and the next input operation will begin after it).

Note that any content in str before the call is replaced by the newly extracted sequence.

Each extracted character is appended to the string as if its member push_back was called.
